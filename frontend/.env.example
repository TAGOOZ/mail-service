# ⚠️  DEPRECATED: Frontend-specific .env file
# 
# This file is kept for reference only.
# All environment variables are now managed in the root directory's .env file.
# 
# To set up the development environment:
# 1. Copy ../.env.example to ../.env
# 2. Modify the values in ../.env as needed
# 
# The frontend will automatically read environment variables from the root .env file.

# For reference, frontend uses these environment variables:
# VITE_API_BASE_URL, VITE_WS_URL, VITE_APP_TITLE, VITE_DOMAIN
# REACT_APP_API_URL, REACT_APP_WS_URL, REACT_APP_MAIL_DOMAIN
